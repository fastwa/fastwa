## Description

Playwa is a open source project and a excellent way, if you want an easy start on getting commands and interactions. Perfect for building efficient and scalable [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com) applications.

Built with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and based on [@nestjs](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework. Playwa makes use of **websocket** under the hood, saving like half a gig of ram. Also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries and many built-in features, allowing for easy use of third-party plugins which are avaliable.

## Example
Please check [@playwa/example](https://github.com/playwa/example) to see an example usage.
