## Description

If you want an easy start on getting commands on your app. This project comes in with many built-in features, this is the only framework you will need. I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

[Playwa](https://github.com/playwa/playwa) is an extension of [Baileys](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys) and based on [Nestjs](https://github.com/orgs/nestjs). But also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, allowing for easy use of third-party plugins which are avaliable.
